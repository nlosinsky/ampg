#Courses app

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run start` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server:dev
# production
npm run server:prod
```
### run mock-server
To use mock-server you should first install npm dependencies from that folder.
```bash
npm run mock-server
```

### run mock-server and development server
```bash
npm run start
```

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production 
npm run build:prod
```
