#Courses app

##What was created 
- basic project structure
- header, footer, logo fake components
- courses, course details, login page fake components
- course typescript interface based on mock up

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run start` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

# development
npm run start
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

### build files

# development
